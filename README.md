## Description

### Introducing live updates!

Have you ever wanted an easy way to browse GitHub by programming language or by username to find issues which need resolved? Now you can! Our app brings you an intuitive interface that allows you to browse repository issues by language or by repository owner. When you click on the dynamically generated elements, they bring you to the GitHub page where you can view the issue on Github. This allows you to easily find ways to contribute to the open-source coding community.

## Deployed Site

Follow [this link](https://ashlynn4567.github.io/Git-It-Done/) to view and use my site!

## Features

This is how the main page appears to users. The page is responsive, adapting to multiple screen sizes.

<p align="center">
<img alt="Screenshot of the Git it Done homepage, displaying a search bar to the left-hand side where users can search by username or programming language. The main portion of the page shows search results, displaying github repositories that match the search parameters." src="./assets/images/git-it-done-screenshot.jpg"/>
</p>

The main page appears relatively empty when you first load into it. However, typing a username into the search bar on the right and clicking "Get User" will then display your search results for repositories belonging to that user. Each repository will list how many issues it currently has open, if any. You can also utilize the search by language feature. Simply press the button of the language you wish to search, and the popular results for that language will appear.

<p align="center">
<img alt="A demonstration gif showing the user typing in a username into the search bar. Results show for the searched user. It also shows a user clicking on one of the preset coding language buttons to search repositories by coding language. Clicking on one of the search results will bring users to a new page that displays all of the current issues listed for that repository. " src="./assets/images/git-it-done-demo.gif"/>
</p>

Once clicking on the repository name, a new page opens that lists all issues within that repository. If you click on these dynamically generated elements, they will link you to the github issue page in a separate window. If you ever want to return to the main page, you simply have to click the "Go Back" button in the top left.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)

## Future Development

In the future, I would like to add the following improvements:

- The ability for users to select the options by which they want to sort their results. For example, a button that the user could click to sort alphabetically or by most popular.
- I would like to add the ability to save the search results to the homepage if the user clicks the back button. However, refreshing the page would refresh the results.

I'm always interested in refactoring code to improve it's functionality. If you would like to suggest your own improvements, you can reach me at the links below.
